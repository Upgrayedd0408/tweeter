# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

This app allows users to express their thoughts in 140 characters or less! With the built in character counter, users will get notified if they are over the 140 characters or if they did not enter any text at all. This app also has a responsive design so that it can be viewed on any device and users can still enjoy a great experience.
